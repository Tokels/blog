## Goodie! Keyboard status context provider

Writing good context providers results in maintainable code, always strive to keep your components as clean as possible. Beautiful code: beautiful ðŸ§  with less confusion.

P.s. use this template for other state that could live in the global context, e.g. is the user authenticated? Is it dark or bright theme? The possibilities are endless!

```javascript
import React, {
  ReactElement,
  createContext,
  useContext,
  useEffect,
  useState,
} from "react";
import { Keyboard } from "react-native";

type KeyboardStatusProps = {
  keyboardStatus: boolean,
};

const KeyboardStatusContext =
  createContext < Partial < KeyboardStatusProps >> {};

export function useKeyboardStatus() {
  return useContext(KeyboardStatusContext);
}

export const KeyboardStatusProvider = ({
  children,
}: {
  children: ReactElement,
}) => {
  const [keyboardStatus, setKeyboardStatus] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const showSubscription = Keyboard.addListener("keyboardDidShow", () => {
      setKeyboardStatus(true);
    });
    const hideSubscription = Keyboard.addListener("keyboardDidHide", () => {
      setKeyboardStatus(false);
    });

    return () => {
      showSubscription.remove();
      hideSubscription.remove();
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <KeyboardStatusContext.Provider
      value={{
        keyboardStatus,
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </KeyboardStatusContext.Provider>
  );
};
```
