## Application from scratch - Setup Part 2b. React Native - Simple Authentication

At the end of this article you'll have a fully functional React Native application with simple authication and routing. We'll continue with a template where we've setup an entire React Native application from scratch with type safety, routing with tabs, testing, formatting, linting, local storage, styling, layouting utils, state management both sync and async and side effects handling. To access this template simply run:
`git clone --depth 1 -b v0.0.1 https://github.com/Tokels/react-native-template.git`

All code is open source in [this repository](https://github.com/Tokels/react-native-template).

We'll work according to [this workflow](https://juliastjerna.vercel.app/posts/application-setup-part-01) (GitHub organization, GitHub Projects, Project Boards etc.).

Let's continue the setup with setting up a React Native project from scratch. You can also visit [this project board](https://github.com/orgs/Tokels/projects/2/views/2) where you will be able to see all these steps and the pull requests belonging to each todo-item.

We will continue with this workflow for each step:

1. Add item to "Todo - <placeholder for feature>"
2. Add description
3. Assign item to developer
4. Convert to issue - choose repository where issue belongs too
5. Add label/s
6. Create branch
7. Do what you need to do for the issue
8. Add, commit and push
9. Merge with main, later when CD is setup we will only merge with main if the preview build is successful
10. Securely delete branch

### Step 1.

Cloning template to get a solid starting point:
`git clone --depth 1 -b v0.0.1 https://github.com/Tokels/react-native-template.git`

### Step 2.
